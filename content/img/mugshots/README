Mugshot dimensions are 350x465
The body should be cut off at the waist
The background should be removed and be alpha (and thus must be PNG)
Everything visually important should be within a width of 295 pixels and centered
  - 295 = 320px (smallest mobile) * 0.92 (4% margin either side)
There should be some clearance from the top
  - the name will be positioned about 75px from the top of the image
PNGs should use lossy compression (pngquant or tinypng.com) so we get jpeg-ish file sizes
