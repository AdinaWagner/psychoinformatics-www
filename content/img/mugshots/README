Mugshot dimensions are 350x450
The body should be cut off at the waist
The background should be removed and be alpha (and thus must be PNG)
Everything visually important should be within a width of 295 pixels and centered
  - 295px = 320px (smallest targeted mobile) * 0.92 (4% margin either side)
There should be some clearance from the top
  - the top of the name will start about 60px from the top of the image
PNGs should use lossy compression (pngquant or tinypng.com) so we get jpeg-ish file sizes
