This project is an open invitation to anyone and everyone to participate in a
decentralized effort to explore the opportunities of open science in
neuroimaging. We aim to document how much (scientific) value can be generated
from a data release â€” from the publication of scientific findings derived from
this dataset, algorithms and methods evaluated on this dataset, and/or
extensions of this dataset by acquisition and incorporation of new data.

This project investigates the perception and neural representation of primary
rewards, i.e. tastes, of their visual correspondences (secondary rewards) and of
their (mis)matched combination in the human brain. Aims of this project are: (1)
to identify the motivational, hedonic and category-specific representations
(sweet, sour etc.) of primary rewards, (2) to identify the influence of
secondary reinforcers on these representations and (3) to identify the effects
of overlearned and novel visuo-gustatory correspondences on these and their
functional interplay by means of univariate fMRI-approaches, plus functional
connectivity, classification analysis and functional hyperalignment.
