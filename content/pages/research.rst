The studyforrest project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An open invitation to anyone and everyone to participate in a decentralized
effort to explore the opportunities of open science in neuroimaging. We aim to
document how much (scientific) value can be generated from a data release — from
the publication of scientific findings derived from this dataset, algorithms and
methods evaluated on this dataset, and/or extensions of this dataset by the
acquisition and incorporation of new data.

Anticipation, Processing, and Control of Primary Rewards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An investigation into the perception and neural representation of primary
rewards (i.e. tastes) of their visual correspondences (secondary rewards) and of
their (mis)matched combination in the human brain. The aims of this project are:
1) to identify the motivational, hedonic, and category-specific representations
(sweet, sour etc.) of primary rewards; 2) to identify the influence of secondary
reinforcers on these representations; and 3) identify the effects of
over-learned and novel visuo-gustatory correspondences on these and their
functional interplay by means of univariate fMRI-approaches (plus functional
connectivity), classification analysis, and functional hyperalignment.

Tracing the Template: Investigating the Representation of Perceptual Relevance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project seeks to identify the nature of attentional preferences of
cognitive behaviour, in terms of function (how it affects our behaviour),
physiology (how it is implemented in the brain), and time (how it is affected
by learning/selection history). Specifically, what preferences can it hold, how
do these change as a function of experience, and what are the neural codes
underlying these representations?

A collaboration with S. Pollmann (Experimental Psychology, Institute of
Psychology II, Magdeburg); M. Eimer, Birkbeck College, University of London
(UK); and C.N.L. Olivers, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (NL), this project is
co-funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG; PO 548/16-1).

Completed Projects
------------------

Building Common High-dimensional Models of Neural Representational Spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to decode information from brain activation patterns with
multivariate analysis procedures. Despite this fact, little is known how neural
codes vary across individuals. The main disadvantage of current decoding
approaches is that they have to be built for each brain individually, because
it is difficult to bring two brains into alignment at a fine scale. This
project developed methods that allow for the detection and description of
common neural representations. Individual brain activity patterns are projected
into a common high-dimensional space, to build models of representational
spaces of cortical areas that are valid for a range of stimuli and across
individuals. This includes complex cortial networks that do not respond
consistently on direct stimulation (e.g. social cognition).

A collaboration with the groups of James V. Haxby (Dartmouth College, USA) and
Peter J. Ramadge (Princeton University, USA), this project was funded by the
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (01GQ1112) as well as the US
National Science Foundation (1129764).


Advanced fMRI-based Analysis of Human Sensory Cortex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project focused on the development and validation of new experimental and
neuro-computational approaches for the investigation of the neuronal processing
of sensory input to the human visual cortex. Novel approaches to decode
cortical processing with functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI) are
developed and applied to the analysis of the visual cortex. On the one hand
spatial high-resolution fMRI approaches are established, validated, and
optimized. On the other hand, multivariate data-analysis approaches are adapted,
optimized and applied to the analysis of fMRI data sets. These methodological
developments open up a wide range of applications, not only to deepen our
understanding of the healthy visual system, but also to investigate
pathophysiology and plasticity of the visual system for the optimization of
future therapeutic strategies.

A collaboration with Prof. Michael Hoffmann (Visual Processing Lab, Eye-Clinic,
Magdeburg), this project was funded by the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt as
part of the project "Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences".


The Role of the Posterior Parietal Cortex for Trans- and Intra Dimensional Feature Binding — Multivariate Pattern Analyses of High-field(7T) fMRI Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collaboration with Prof. Stefan Pollmann (Experimental Psychology, Institute
of Psychology II, Magdeburg), this project was funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG; PO 548/10-1).
